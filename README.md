# Sorting Visualizer

The sorting algorithm visualizer is a web application that allows users to visualize the process of sorting an array using four popular algorithms: merge sort, quick sort, bubble sort, and heap sort. The application is built using ReactJS and JavaScript and includes the ability to generate a new array with adjustable size and sorting speed. The visual representation of the sorting process, along with CSS styling, provides a clear and engaging experience for users to understand the behavior of different sorting algorithms. It is a work in progress.
